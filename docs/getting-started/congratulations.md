# Congratulations

ðŸŽ‰	Congratulations on completing the quick start documentation for ChattY and successfully creating a Chat app! This is a great accomplishment and I'm sure you're proud of it. We look forward to seeing what you are going to do in the future.

However the journey doesn't stop here. We provided you with pre-assembled containers however nothing is stopping you from building your own containers. And we know it's a tedious task so we have **micro-components** that you can use and customize to build a Chat UI unique to your app.

Feel free to explore the next section to learn about these micro-components ðŸ™Œ
